#### "How can we allow the Savior to gather us as his sheep"
- Doctrine and Covenants 88:63
- Here is His invitation to us: “Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you; seek me diligently and ye shall find me; ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.”
- Consistent Persistent changes
- Taking the words to heart. Thinking, "how that affect my life/How can I allow that to change me?"
- Don't take the Gospel as cool facts or interesting knowledge, but take it personally
- Mosiah 18:8-9	
	8. As ye are desirous to come into the fold of God, and to be called his people, and are willing to bear one another’s burdens, that they may be light;
	9. Yea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places … , even until death, that ye may be redeemed of God, … that ye may have eternal life.
- Elder Eyring promises:
	"As you are faithful to these promises, you will find that the Lord keeps His promise to be one with you in your service, making your burdens light. You will come to know the Savior, and in time you will come to be like Him and “be perfected in him.”By helping others for the Savior, you will find that you are drawing nearer to Him."
- Bringing family members back is not your job. Creating an environment where they can feel loved and more easily feel the spirit is what will allow the spirit to do its job.
- As we continue to strive to follow Jesus Christ we can be made whole. We can be whole while we wait for healing but being wholehearted in Him
- Camille Johnson says:
	"We are whole in Jesus Christ when we exercise our agency to follow Him in faith, submit our hearts to Him so He can change them, keep His commandments, and enter a covenant relationship with Him, meekly enduring and learning from the challenges of this earthly estate until we return to His presence and are healed in every way. I can be whole while I wait for healing if I am wholehearted in my relationship with Him."
- Camille Johnson says:
	"The Lord told Enos his faith had made him “whole.” Wholeness came as Enos pondered on the words of his prophet-father, Jacob, as he hungered to understand the opportunity for eternal life, as he cried unto God in mighty prayer. And in that state of desire and humility, the voice of the Lord came to him, announcing his sins were forgiven. And Enos asked the Lord, “How is it done?” And the Lord responded, “Because of thy faith in Christ, … thy faith hath made thee whole.”"
- Camille Johnson says:
	"Through our faith in Jesus Christ, we can seek to be spiritually whole while we wait and hope for physical and emotional healing."

### Key Themes

**1. Distinction Between Healing and Wholeness**

President Johnson references the biblical account of the ten lepers healed by Jesus, noting that while all were physically healed, only one returned to express gratitude and was told, “Thy faith hath made thee whole.” This illustrates that spiritual wholeness transcends physical healing.

**2. Achieving Spiritual Wholeness**

She emphasizes that spiritual wholeness is attained by exercising faith in Jesus Christ, submitting our hearts to Him, keeping His commandments, and entering into a covenant relationship with Him. This process involves enduring life's challenges with meekness and learning from them until we return to His presence.

**3. Faith and Hope as Interconnected Forces**

President Johnson explains that faith in Jesus Christ begets hope, and striving for wholeness through faith reinforces this hope. This cyclical relationship strengthens individuals as they await physical or emotional healing.

**4. Scriptural Examples of Spiritual Wholeness**

She cites Enos, who, through sincere prayer and faith, received forgiveness of sins and was made whole. Similarly, the Apostle Paul, despite his “thorn in the flesh,” found strength in Christ, demonstrating that spiritual wholeness is possible even without physical healing.

**5. The Role of Conversion and Light**

Drawing from the parable of the ten virgins, President Johnson underscores the importance of being spiritually prepared by filling our lamps with the oil of conversion to Jesus Christ. Sharing this light with others not only brings relief to them but also deepens our own conversion and joy.

**6. Assurance of Future Healing**

She reassures that while physical and emotional healing may not occur in this life, complete restoration will come through the Resurrection. In the meantime, individuals can choose to be spiritually whole by exercising faith in Jesus Christ.

President Johnson concludes by affirming her own conversion to the Lord Jesus Christ and expressing confidence in eventual healing, emphasizing that spiritual wholeness is achievable now through faith and devotion.
