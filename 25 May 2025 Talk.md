### Key Themes

**1. Distinction Between Healing and Wholeness**

President Johnson references the biblical account of the ten lepers healed by Jesus, noting that while all were physically healed, only one returned to express gratitude and was told, “Thy faith hath made thee whole.” This illustrates that spiritual wholeness transcends physical healing.

**2. Achieving Spiritual Wholeness**

She emphasizes that spiritual wholeness is attained by exercising faith in Jesus Christ, submitting our hearts to Him, keeping His commandments, and entering into a covenant relationship with Him. This process involves enduring life's challenges with meekness and learning from them until we return to His presence.

**3. Faith and Hope as Interconnected Forces**

President Johnson explains that faith in Jesus Christ begets hope, and striving for wholeness through faith reinforces this hope. This cyclical relationship strengthens individuals as they await physical or emotional healing.

**4. Scriptural Examples of Spiritual Wholeness**

She cites Enos, who, through sincere prayer and faith, received forgiveness of sins and was made whole. Similarly, the Apostle Paul, despite his “thorn in the flesh,” found strength in Christ, demonstrating that spiritual wholeness is possible even without physical healing.

**5. The Role of Conversion and Light**

Drawing from the parable of the ten virgins, President Johnson underscores the importance of being spiritually prepared by filling our lamps with the oil of conversion to Jesus Christ. Sharing this light with others not only brings relief to them but also deepens our own conversion and joy.

**6. Assurance of Future Healing**

She reassures that while physical and emotional healing may not occur in this life, complete restoration will come through the Resurrection. In the meantime, individuals can choose to be spiritually whole by exercising faith in Jesus Christ.

President Johnson concludes by affirming her own conversion to the Lord Jesus Christ and expressing confidence in eventual healing, emphasizing that spiritual wholeness is achievable now through faith and devotion.
