They shared a story from Elder Holland where he was on a hike with his son and they came to a fork in the road. They prayed on which direction to go and they decided both that they felt they should go left. Quickly they came to a cliff face and realized that they couldn't go any further in that direction. Elder Holland's son asked him why did they both feel that they should go that way?
