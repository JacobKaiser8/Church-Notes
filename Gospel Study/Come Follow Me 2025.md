### Doctrine and Covenants: Section 1

"You should write your paper before you write your introduction"
This section was not written first it was written after several sections had already been written. This is an introductory section and so lays out what the "Doctrine and Covenants" will entail.

Verse 24
Given in our weakness and in our language so that we might come to an understanding

Verse 30 - "True and Living"
This verse is interesting because most of my life and especially on my mission I took it as the only church that has truth". However, in the "followHIM" podcast, they bring up that this is the only church that is living in the sense that truth is still coming forth.

I had a though a while ago that this is the only church with the fullness of truth meaning that there is a measure of truth in many churches but The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints is the church has the most. In addition to that, the living part means that we do not have all the truth yet. Article of Faith #9 states that "We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that **He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God."** 

I have been listening to many more theological people and "experts" talk about the bible and religion in general and it is interesting how many of them seem to contradict themselves but do share a lot of truths. The gospel of Jesus Christ as found in both the Book of Mormon and The Bible in conjunction with modern day prophets reveals that fulness of knowledge. In addition, it is more evident in that with the hope and faith that a living and real church brings. 

I think it would be very hard to have faith and hope in a church that did not directly communicate with Heavenly Father and receive revelation from him. With Joseph Smith showing via The Restoration that God still talks to his people shows that we can have faith that he is leading and guiding us today.
